ðŸ§  BT XML Design Summary
The BT (navigate_bt.xml) implements two mission modes:

ðŸ”¸ Mission 1: Navigate to fixed goal pose
Compute â†’ Smooth â†’ Follow path

On arrival: emit signal + exit

ðŸ”¸ Mission 2: Cover a circular area
Generate a goal from circular boundary (SetCircularCoverageGoal)

Compute â†’ Smooth â†’ Follow path

Interrupt if /object_found is published:

Get new goal

Switch mission to NAV_TO_GOAL

Abort current path and resume with new plan





ðŸ§© Notes on Custom BT Nodes
You will need to implement the following custom condition/action nodes or re-use existing ones with remapping:

Node Name	Type	Description
CheckMissionType	Condition	Compares current mission mode (NAV_TO_GOAL, COVER_AREA)
SetCircularCoverageGoal	Action	Computes a goal pose within a circular area
ObjectFound	Condition	Reads boolean flag from topic
GetObjectLocation	Action	Extracts object location and returns PoseStamped
SetMissionType	Action	Writes new mission mode
SignalNavigationComplete	Action	Emits completion signal (e.g. topic or GPIO)
AbortCurrentCoverage	Action	Optional, clears current path/goal
